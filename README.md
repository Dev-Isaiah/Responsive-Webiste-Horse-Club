# Responsive Horse Club Website CSS/HTML Project

## Overview:
This was a project from Codecademy that had requirements that I had to follow in order complete the project as intended! This meant that I had to use percentages for image resizes and dynamic text for each screen size!

**BELOW are a few FEATURES I used to complete the project:**
-   em's and em's: For dynamic font sizes from top to bottom of the page
-   percentages: Used in spacing and images throughout the web page
-   @medias: The media queries were effective with the more dynamic layout of images and some sizing for different screen widths.

## Languages:
 - [x] HTML
